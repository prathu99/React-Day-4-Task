            <p>SB Admin 2 makes extensive use of Bootstrap 4 utility classes in order to reduce CSS bloat and poor page performance.
                Custom CSS classes are used to create custom components and custom utility classes.</p>
            <p>
                Before working with this theme, you should become familiar with the Bootstrap framework, especially the utility classes.
